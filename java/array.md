1. What is an Array?
   - An Array is collection of items
   - These items could be Integers, Strings
   - These items are stored in Contiguous memory location
   - An Array can hold up to N items
   - An Array is a collection of items of same data type stored at contiguous memory locaion


2. What is Array capacity?
   - The Capacity of a Array in Java can be checked by length Attribute
   - The Length of a Array is the number of elements currently in the Array

3. What is Time Complexity of an Array?
   ```
   - Access    O(1) Best -  O(1) Worst
   - Search    O(N) Best -  O(N) Worst
   - Insertion O(N) Best -  O(N) Worst
   - Deletion  O(N) Best -  O(N) Worst
   - The Space complexity of an Array in Worst case is O(N)
   ```

4. Types of Array?

   ```
     - Static Arrays
     - Dynamic Arrays

   ```

5. Static Arrays
   ```
     - The size or the number of  elements in static arrays are fixed
     - The arrays contents can be modified but memory space allocated to remain constant
 
   ```

6. When should an Array be used?
   ```
   - Arrays are Excellent for lookups, pushing and poping are really quick.
   - Arrays are bad as insertions, Deletions

   ```
