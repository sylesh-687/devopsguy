1. What is an Array?
   - An Array is collection of items
   - These items could be Integers, Strings
   - These items are stored in Contiguous memory location
   - An Array can hold up to N items
   - An Array is a collection of items of same data type stored at contiguous memory locaion
   - An Array is a basic data structure to store collections of elements sequentially. But elements can be accessed randonly	


2. What is Array capacity?
   - The Capacity of a Array in Java can be checked by length Attribute
   - The Length of a Array is the number of elements currently in the Array

3. What is Time Complexity of an Array?
   ```
   - Access    O(1) Best -  O(1) Worst
   - Search    O(N) Best -  O(N) Worst
   - Insertion O(N) Best -  O(N) Worst
   - Deletion  O(N) Best -  O(N) Worst
   - The Space complexity of an Array in Worst case is O(N)
   ```

4. Types of Array?

   ```
     - Static Arrays
     - Dynamic Arrays

   ```

5. Static Arrays
   ```
     - The size or the number of  elements in static arrays are fixed
     - The arrays contents can be modified but memory space allocated to remain constant
 
   ```

6. When should an Array be used?
   ```
   - Arrays are Excellent for lookups, pushing and poping are really quick.
   - Arrays are bad as insertions, Deletions

   ```
7. Deletion of an Array?
   ```
      - Deletion of the elements from the last.
      - Deletion of the first element 
      - Deletion from any given Index

    ```

8. What is 2D Array?
   ```
     - Similar to 1D array 2D Array also consists of a sequence of elements, but the elements can be laid out it rectangular Grid
   ```

9. What is Arraylist?
    - ArrayList class is a resizable array. This is found in Java.util package
   

10. What is the principle of hashtable?
   ```
      - Hash table is a data structure , which organizes data using hash functions. Inorder to support quick insertions and search.
      - The key idea of Hash Table is to hash function to map keys to buckets.
      - When we insert a new key. The hash function decides which bucket the key should be assigned and the key will be assigned in corresponding bucket
      - When we search the hash table will use the same hash function to find the corresponding bucket and search only specific bucket.

   ```
